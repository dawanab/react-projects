############################## STATE ##################################
> React state holds the data for a component. The component then returns the 
data that's contained within the state to the output. 

I. What is 'state' in ReactJS? -------------------------------->
    > State is a built-in object that contains data about the component. A 
    compoenent's state can change over time, and when it does, the component 
    re-renders. State change can happen with user responses, or system-generated
    events, and this determines the behavior and how the componenet will render.

    > State can be modified via user interaction or system-generated.
    > When the state changes, the component is re-rendered.
    > The state object is initialized in the constructor.
    > It can store multiple properties.
    > this.setState() is used to change the value of the state object.
    > setState() funnction performs a merge between the new and prev state.


II. The setState() Method -------------------------------------->
    > State can be updated in response to event hanndlers or prop changes. This
    is done via setState() method. It queues all of the updates made to the 
    compoenent state, and then directs React to re-render the component and 
    its children with the updated state. 

    > You should always use the setState() method to change the object's state,
    because it ensures the componenet knows it's been updated and it can 
    then call the render() method.
