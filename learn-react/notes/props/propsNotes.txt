Props provide us with a way to pass information between components in React;
They are arguments passed into react components.

I. Props in ReactJS ---------------------------------------------->
    > Because React is a component based library, the UI is divided into small, 
    resuable pieces. In order for these components to be able to pass data to 
    and from one another, we need to use props. 

    > Props are read-only. That means that the data coming from a parent component cannot be changed by the child component. 

II. Using Props --------------------------------------------------->
    > There are three steps that we need to follow in order to use props:
        1. Define an attribute and its value
        2. Pass it to a child component or components by using props 
        3. Render the props data. 

    > We can add props like we pass an argument to a function.
