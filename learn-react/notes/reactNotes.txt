I. What is React? ---------------------------->
    > React is a JavaScript-based UI development library that was created by 
    Facebook in 2013. It is one of the most commonly used frontend libraries 
    for web development. 


II. Why React? --------------------------------->
    > It is easy to create dynamic web applications with React because it often
    requires less code and offers more functionality. 

    > It uses the virtualDOM. The virtualDOM only updates the states on the real 
    DOM if they were changed on the virtualDOM.

    > It offers reusable components. Components are the building blocks of React. 
    A single app consists of multiple components that can be reused throughout
    the application, shortening the development time. 

    > Unidirectional data flow. Developers often nest child components inside of 
    parent components, making the data flow in a single direction. This makes it 
    easier to debug errors.

    > React can be used to build web or mobile applications. React Native is the 
    framework that allows us to build for mobile. 


III. Features of React --------------------------->
    > JSX: JavaScript syntactic extension; describes how the UI should appear.
    Allows us to write HTML structures within the same JS file; embeds HTML
    into JS code. 


IV. Components in React --------------------------->
    > Components represent a part of the user interface.
