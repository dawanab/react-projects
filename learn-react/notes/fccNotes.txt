USING PROPS WITH STATELESS FUNCTIONAL CCOMPONENTS ------------------------>
    > A stateless functional component is any function you write which 
    accepts props and returns JSX. 
    > A stateless component is a class that extends React.Component, but does 
    not use internal state.

    > A stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own 
    internal state; referred to as React components. 


CREATE A STATEFUL COMPONENT ----------------------------------------------->
    > State consists of any data your application needs to know about that 
    can change over time. 
    > You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated 
    UI when necessary. 

    > You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on 
    the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component 
    with state when it is created. 
    > You have access to the state object throughout the life of your 
    component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props
    to child components. 


RENDER STATE IN THE UI ---------------------------------------------------->
    > If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in 
    state in its rener() method. You can access the data with this.state. 

    > React uses a virtualDOM to keep track of changes behind the scenes. 
    When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using 
    that data. React updates the actual DOM, but only when necessary. 
    This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM, you just 
    declare what the UI should look like. 

    > If you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its 
    state. It's state is local to that component, unless you pass state data
    to a child component as props. 

SET STATE WITH this.setState () ------------------------------------------>
    > React provides a method for updating component state called setState.
    > You call the setState method within your component class such as:
    this.setState(), passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys 
    are the state properties and the values are the updated state data. 
    > React expects you to never modify state directly, instead use 
    this.setState() when state changes occur. 


BIND 'THIS' TO A CLASS METHOD -------------------------------------------->
    > A class method typically needs to use the this keyword so it can 
    access properties on the class (such as state and props) inside the scope
    of the method.
        1. One common way is to explicitly bind this in the constructor so 
        this becomes bound to the class methods when the componenet is 
        initialized: this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);


USE STATE TO TOGGLE AN ELEMENT ------------------------------------------->
    > Sometimes you might need to know the previous state when updating the 
    state. So you should pass setState a function that allows you to access
    state and props. Using a function with setState guarantees you are 
    working with the most current values of state and props. You have to
    wrap the object literal in parentheses, otherwise JS thinks it's a block
    of code. (example in 'simple-counter' directory).


PASS STATE AS PROPS TO CHILD COMPONENTS ---------------------------------->
    > Unidirectional data flow - state flows in one direction down the tree  
    of your application's componenets, from the stateful parent componenet  
    to child componenets. The child componenets only receive the state data
    they need. 


PASS A CALLBACK AS PROPS ------------------------------------------------->
    > You can pass state as props, handler functions, or any method that's
    defined on a React component to child components. This is how you allow
    child componenets to interact with their parent componenets. 


Â ðŸŒˆ /*  topics ---> lifecycle-methods    */
USE THE LIFECYCLE METHOD componenetWillMount ----------------------------->
    > React componenets have several methods that provide opportunities to 
    perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a componenet.
    These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you 
    to catch componenets at certain points in time. This can be before they 
    are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they
    unmount, and so on. 
        > componenetWillMount()     > shouldComponentUpdate()
        > componentWillUnMount()    > componenetDidMount()      
        > componenetDidUpdate()

    > The componenetWillMount lifecycle method is called before the render() 
    method when a componenet is being mounted to the DOM. 


USE THE LIFECYCLE METHOD componenetDidMount ------------------------------->
    > The best pracrice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your 
    server in the lifecycle method componenetDidMount(). This method is called 
    after a componenet is mounted to the DOM. 
    > Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component.
    When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that 
    the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive
    the data. 

    > componentDidMount is also a good place to place any event listeners you
    need to add for specific functionality. 


ADD EVENT LISTENERS -------------------------------------------------------->
    > React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event 
    system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system
    behaves the same regardless of the user's browser. 


OPTIMIZE RE-RENDERS WITH shouldComponentUpdate ----------------------------->
    > shouldComponentUpdate() is used when child components receive new state 
    or props, and allows us to specifically decide if the components should 
    update or not. It takes nextProps and nextState as parameters. The method 
    should return a boolean value that tells React to update the component 
    or not. 
    > This method is useful to optimize performance. 

Â ðŸŒˆ /*  topics ---> inline-styles   */
INTRODUCTING INLINE STYLES ------------------------------------------------->
    > If you import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different from 
    styling HTML. You apply a class to your JSX element using the className
    attribute, and apply styles to the class in yout stylesheet. Another 
    option is inline styles. 
    > JSX elements use the style attribute, but you set the value equal to 
    a JS object: <div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>


ADD INLINE STYLES IN REACT ------------------------------------------------->
