I. What is React? ---------------------------->
    > React is a JavaScript-based UI development library that was created by 
    Facebook in 2013. It is one of the most commonly used frontend libraries 
    for web development. 


II. Why React? --------------------------------->
    > It is easy to create dynamic web applications with React because it often
    requires less code and offers more functionality. 

    > It uses the virtualDOM. The virtualDOM only updates the states on the real 
    DOM if they were changed on the virtualDOM.

    > It offers reusable components. Components are the building blocks of React. 
    A single app consists of multiple components that can be reused throughout
    the application, shortening the development time. 

    > Unidirectional data flow. Developers often nest child components inside of 
    parent components, making the data flow in a single direction. This makes it 
    easier to debug errors.

    > React can be used to build web or mobile applications. React Native is the 
    framework that allows us to build for mobile. 


III. Features of React --------------------------->
    > JSX: JavaScript syntactic extension; describes how the UI should appear.
    Allows us to write HTML structures within the same JS file; embeds HTML
    into JS code. 


IV. Components in React --------------------------->
    > Components represent a part of the user interface. The UI is separated into
    numerous components, and each component has its own set of properties and 
    functions. 
        ** A component used in one area can be reused in another area
        ** A component can containn several other components.
        ** A component must at least have a render() method that specifies how
        the component renders to the DOM. 
        ** A component can receive props (properties); they are passed by its 
        parent to specify values. 

    > Export default is used to export only one object from the file (function, 
    variable, class). Only one default export per file is allowed. 


V. Props in React ---------------------------------->
    > Props allow the user to pass arguemnts or data to the components. This is 
    what makes the components dynamic. They are read-only and can't be changed. 


VI. State in React ---------------------------------->
    > State is an object that stores a component's properties values
    that could change over time. 
        ** State can be changed because of a user's action or network changes
        ** The component is re-rendered when state changes 
        ** setState() is used to alter the state object's value 

VII. setState() Method ------------------------------>
    > State can be updated to event handlers, server responses, or changes to 
    the props. 

VIII. Props vs. State -------------------------------->
    > Props - sends data and event handlers to a component's children
    > State - the data of the components that must be presented to it, store 
    the view in the state 

    > Props - immutable; can't be modified after they've been set
    > State - the data is stired in state, which may change over time 

    > Props - both functional and class components can benefit from props
    > State - only class compoenents can use state 

    > Props - the parent compoenent sets props for the children compoenents
    > State - event handlers are typically responsible for updating state
